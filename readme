## 🎯 Project Goal

Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior to:
- Identify high-value customers
- Create personalized marketing campaigns
- Reduce customer churn
- Optimize marketing budget allocation

---

## 📊 Methodology

### RFM Analysis
**R**ecency - How recently did the customer purchase?  
**F**requency - How often do they purchase?  
**M**onetary - How much do they spend?

### K-Means Clustering
Group customers into segments based on RFM scores

---

## 📁 Dataset

**Source:** Online Retail Dataset  
**Customers:** 4,372 unique customers  
**Metrics Analyzed:** Purchase recency, frequency, monetary value

---

## 🔍 Analysis Process

### 1. Data Preparation (SQL)
```sql
-- Calculate RFM metrics
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    DATEDIFF(day, MAX(InvoiceDate), '2011-12-31') as Recency,
    COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) as Frequency,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) as Monetary
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY CustomerID;
```

### 2. RFM Scoring (Python)
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Normalize RFM values
scaler = StandardScaler()
rfm_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(rfm_df)

# Apply K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
rfm_df['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(rfm_scaled)
```

### 3. Customer Segments Identified

| Segment | Characteristics | Marketing Strategy |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Champions** | Recent buyers, frequent purchases, high spend | VIP rewards, early access |
| **Loyal Customers** | Regular purchases, moderate spend | Loyalty program, upsell |
| **At Risk** | Haven't purchased recently, used to spend well | Re-engagement campaign |
| **Lost Customers** | Long time since purchase | Win-back offers |

## 📈 Key Findings

### 🏆 Customer Distribution
- **Champions:** 15% (£3.2M revenue)
- **Loyal Customers:** 35% (£4.1M revenue)
- **At Risk:** 28% (£1.8M revenue)
- **Lost Customers:** 22% (£0.6M revenue)

### 💰 Revenue Impact
- Top 15% customers generate 35% of revenue
- 28% of customers are at risk of churning
- Win-back potential: £1.8M from at-risk segment

### 📊 Behavioral Patterns
- Champions purchase every 23 days on average
- Lost customers haven't purchased in 180+ days
- Loyal customers have 8+ lifetime orders
